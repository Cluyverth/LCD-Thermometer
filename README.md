# LCD-Thermometer

This is a prototype of a LCD Thermometer.

*I do this project in the college so It's not really refined, but works*

## What you will need to do the project:

---
    -> PIC 16F877A
    -> 4 MHz crystal
    -> LM35 temperature sensor
    -> LCD Display 16x2
    -> Some resistors, potentiometer and buttons

## SCHEMATIC OF THE PROJECT

    I lost the project schematic when I switched PCs, so I took an image from google and edited it to look like the original schematic.
